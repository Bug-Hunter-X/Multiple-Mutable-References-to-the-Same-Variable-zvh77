This example demonstrates a common error in Rust related to borrowing and mutability.  The core issue lies in attempting to create multiple mutable references (`&mut`) to the same variable (`x`). Rust's ownership and borrowing system strictly prevents this to guarantee memory safety and data integrity. The compiler will prevent this from compiling with a descriptive error message. The solution involves refactoring the code to use only one mutable reference at a time or to utilize techniques like interior mutability if concurrent modification is required.
